# dPay
dPay is a payment system where you can send money to users and shops and also divide the money during the transaction. 

## Further work
We will further BLE technology to search for nearby devices registered in our database. When the users sends us request to divide the money, we will send a notification to the user to pay. Each transaction is stored separately and are checked if it is completed or not. If all the users have payed, we wiil send the money to the store/user

## how to start
go to client and do npm install. Then perform npm start and press w for web, and i for ios.
While the AWS RDS is running, we are developing express side on the local machine with CORS.
You would not be able to run the server locally without a .env file specifying the AWS location.
